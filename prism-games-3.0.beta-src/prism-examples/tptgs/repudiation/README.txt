This case study concerns the non-repudiation protocol of Markowitch & Roggeman [MR99].

These are turn-based probabilistic timed game (TPTG) models, which are an extension of
stochastic multi-player games with real-valued clocks or, equivalently, a game-based
extension of probabilistic timed automaton (PTA).

This case study [KNP19] extends the the PTA version from [NPS13], the files for which
can be found in ../../ptas/repudiation. Both are extensions of the PTA model developed
in [LMST04].
