Collective Decision Making for Sensor Networks

This case study is based on a distributed consensus algorithm for sensor networks [SS12],
modelled and verified in [CFK+13b].

File name meanings:
* cdmsn3032.prism - model: 3 sensors, 0 of which deterministic, 3 targets, 2 confidence levels
* cdmsn3.props - properties for 3 sensors
