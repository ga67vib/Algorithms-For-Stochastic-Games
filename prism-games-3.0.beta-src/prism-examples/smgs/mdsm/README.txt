Microgrid Demand-Side Management

This case study is based on the distributed energy management algorithm for smart grids
by Hildmann & Saffre [HS11], modelled and verified in [CFK+13b]. The files here
correspond to a model of the protocol where households are allowed to "cheat"
(deviate from the protocol). In [CFK+13b], a fix is proposed where households
are punished for deviating. These models are the "no-punishment" variant.

File name explanation:
* mdsm2304.{prism,props} - 2 households, 3 day time horizon, 0 deterministic households, 4 jobs
