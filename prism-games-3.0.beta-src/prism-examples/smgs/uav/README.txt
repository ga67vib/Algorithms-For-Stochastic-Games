This case study is based on [FWHT15] and considers the control of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is interacting with a human operator. We consider strategy synthesis for the UAV, while the operator is modelled as an uncontrollable, potentially adverse, environment from the perspective of the UAV, leading to a stochastic game formulation.

The model is in uav.prism, and the properties in uav.props.
