Update README:
	- List all algos we have and which are new with sources (GandALF, OVI-paper etc.)
	- Make proper install script and clean up
	- Have a big comparison table in repo (and make sure it makes sense)
	- Have visualization scripts
	
For the ongoing document:
	- Prelims describing all algos high level
	- Big comparison table and visualizations
		In particular, for some examples have a "how did the bounds evolve over time" graph, so we see how normal VI from above gets stuck, how OVI guesses upper bounds and how SVI makes intuitive jumps etc.
