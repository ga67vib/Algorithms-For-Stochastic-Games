# Algorithms-For-Stochastic-Games

Extension of PRISM-games (link).
Algorithms as described in GandALF submission "Title".

## Installation

Standard PRISM tutorial.
For QP stuff [TODO: Sasha write tutorial]

## TODO:
- put code here (Merging master and finish by hand as appropriate, excluding class files and the like)
- Check license of PRISM, check where to add our names
- Fix things in Readme
- Try it out
- If time permits: Make it work even without license; maybe by putting a dummy license file called 'your-license-here' and telling gurobi/AMPL to look there
